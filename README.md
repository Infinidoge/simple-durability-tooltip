# Simple Durability Tooltip

Shows the durability tooltip on a damaged item, regardless of if Advanced Tooltips is enabled or not.

This is implemented as a very simple single mixin, and has no configuration options whatsoever. It is handled the exact same way Vanilla handles it, so it is fully translated.
